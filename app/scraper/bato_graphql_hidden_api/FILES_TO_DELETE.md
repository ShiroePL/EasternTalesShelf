# Files to Delete - Cleanup List

**Date**: 2025-10-20

```
bato_manga_details_scraper.py  ‚Üí Replaced by: bato_manga_details_graphql.py
bato_chapters_list.py          ‚Üí Replaced by: bato_chapters_list_graphql.py
```

---

## ‚úÖ SAFE TO DELETE - Discovery/Investigation Files

These were used to discover and test the GraphQL API:

```
discover_full_api.py
discover_queries.py
discover_subscriptions.py
discover_mangaupdates.py
final_test.py
pattern_test.py
refine_test.py
test_graphql.py
try_grapg.py
scraping_html_something.py
mangaupdates_deep_dive.py
mangaupdates_slug_converter.py
```

---

## ‚úÖ SAFE TO DELETE - Test Output/Result JSON Files

These are output files from testing and investigation:

```
102497-please-don-t-come-to-the-villainess-stationery-store.json
API_COMIC_DETAILS_FULL.json
API_COMIC_WITH_EMOTIONS.json
API_COMIC_WITH_RATINGS.json

## ‚úÖ SAFE TO DELETE - Test Output Folder

```
102497-please-don-t-come-to-the-villainess-stationery-store/  (entire folder)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW BEFORE DELETING - Investigation Documentation

These are documentation files from the investigation phase. You might want to keep them for reference:

```
BATOTWO_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ANALYSIS.md  (probably not needed - subscriptions aren't used)
MANGAUPDATES_API_ANALYSIS.md      (if you're not using MangaUpdates API, delete it)
```

---

## ‚úÖ KEEP - Essential Files

**DO NOT DELETE** these files:

```
batotwo_client.py                   ‚úÖ KEEP - Reusable GraphQL client with CLI
bato_manga_details_graphql.py       ‚úÖ KEEP - NEW GraphQL manga details scraper
bato_chapters_list_graphql.py       ‚úÖ KEEP - NEW GraphQL chapters list scraper
bato_models.py                      ‚úÖ KEEP - Data models (if still used)

## üìä Summary

- **Old scrapers to delete**: 2 files
- **Discovery/test scripts to delete**: 12 files  
- **Test output JSON to delete**: 12 files
- **Test folders to delete**: 1 folder
- **Optional docs to delete**: 2 files

**Total to delete**: ~29 files/folders

**After cleanup, you'll have**:
- `batotwo_client.py` - GraphQL client with CLI
- `bato_manga_details_graphql.py` - NEW manga details scraper
- `bato_chapters_list_graphql.py` - NEW chapters list scraper  
- `bato_models.py` - Data models
- `final_complete_queries.py` - Query examples
- `BATOTWO_GRAPHQL_API_DOCS.md` - API documentation
- `STEALTH_AND_RATE_LIMITING.md` - Production notes
- `batotwo_data/` - Output folder
- `message.txt` - (check this first)

---

**‚úÖ This cleanup is safe because**:
1. Old Playwright scrapers are completely replaced by GraphQL versions
2. All discovery/test files were one-time investigation scripts
3. Test output JSONs are not used by any code
4. Essential files (client, new scrapers, docs) are preserved
